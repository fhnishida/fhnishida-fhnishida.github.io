abstract: In recent decades, territorial reforms have shown contrasting trends globally. Developed countries have focused on consolidating local governments into larger units for economies of scale and efficiency, while developing countries have opted for fragmentation to enhance political representation and resource allocation. This essay investigates how territorial divisions impact local governments in Brazil, focusing on their effects on political engagement and fiscal sustainability. 
 We analyze data from 1988 to 2019, covering 621 areas affected by municipal splits. We gathered voter turnout data from the Regional Electoral Courts (TREs) and the Superior Electoral Court (TSE) since 1988, along with local public financial data from 1991 to 2019. Our methodology employs a difference-in-differences estimator that is robust to group and time heterogeneity, using municipalities that attempted to split but were unsuccessful as a control group.
 Our study highlights two key findings. First, political engagement increased following the implementation of administrative divisions in both municipal and general elections. However, it becomes non-significant after ten years. Second, territorial fragmentation led to a higher reliance on vertical transfers and an increase in both current and capital expenditures, all without affecting the fiscal balance. Nonetheless, this fragmentation did not result in greater economic growth, which raises questions about the effectiveness of this policy.

summary: This study examines the impact of municipal splits on political engagement and fiscal sustainability in Brazil, analyzing data from 1988 to 2019 across 621 affected areas. Using a difference-in-differences approach, we find an initial rise in political engagement that fades after a decade. Additionally, fragmentation increases reliance on vertical transfers and raises expenditures without improving fiscal balance or fostering economic growth, questioning its effectiveness.
