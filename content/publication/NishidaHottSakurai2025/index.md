abstract: In recent decades, territorial reforms have shown contrasting trends globally. Developed countries have focused on consolidating local governments into larger units for economies of scale and efficiency, while developing countries have opted for fragmentation to enhance political representation and resource allocation. This paper examines the impact of territorial divisions on local governments in Brazil, with a focus on their effects on political engagement. 
 We analyze Brazilian electoral data from 1988 to 2020, covering 621 areas affected by municipal splits, provided by the Regional Electoral Courts (TREs) and the Superior Electoral Court (TSE). Our methodology employs a difference-in-differences estimator that is robust to group and time heterogeneity, using municipalities that attempted to split but were unsuccessful as a control group.
 Our study reveals an increase in political engagement after the implementation of administrative divisions in both municipal and general elections. This effect is further amplified in highly fragmented areas impacted by this territorial reform.
