abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly exacerbated the crisis in the 
 Brazilian labor market. Against this backdrop, our study seeks to identify the 
 characteristics that render workers more vulnerable to declines in occupational 
 status, with a particular focus on informal workers. To this end, we employ a 
 multinomial logit model and the Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition. The findings 
 underscore the intensification of structural inequality in Brazilian society 
 during periods of crisis, highlighting the critical role of informality, which 
 may even surpass individual worker characteristics in explaining the risk of 
 unemployment. Informal workers also faced heightened risks concerning labor 
 income and wage disparities.
