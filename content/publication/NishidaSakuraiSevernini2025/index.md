abstract: Natural disasters can cause substantial damage to human lives, the
 environment, and the economy, leading to financial strain on subnational governments. 
 This study examines the impact of extreme weather events on the local public 
 finances in Brazil, focusing on government funding strategies for relief measures
 and policies to reduce future risks associated with such hazards.
 We leverage Standard Precipitation and Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) data to
 identify extreme floods and droughts in 5,474 municipalities from 1997 to 2019.
 Then, we estimate the effects of these disasters on local public finance by 
 employing an approach that combines a difference-in-differences estimator with 
 a matching method and allows treatments with switching on and off behavior.
 Our findings reveal that droughts do not significantly impact intergovernmental
 transfers, leading to financial strain for the affected municipalities. 
 Conversely, floods increase the grants received by local governments, improving
 their fiscal balances. However, this better fiscal situation does not affect the 
 spending in flood mitigation areas (urbanism and the environment), suggesting a
 moral hazard problem related to the overreliance on resources from higher-level
 governments.

summary: This study examines Brazilâ€™s fiscal response to extreme weather events, 
 analyzing relief funding and risk mitigation policies. Using SPEI data from 1997
 to 2019, we identify floods and droughts across 5,474 municipalities and apply a
 difference-in-differences with matching approach. Our findings show that droughts 
 do not affect intergovernmental transfers, creating financial pressure, while
 floods increase grants, improving fiscal balances but failing to boost flood
 mitigation spending, revealing a moral hazard in reliance on higher-level 
 government resources.
